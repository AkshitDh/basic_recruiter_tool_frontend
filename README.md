# Frontend README


This README provides instructions on how to run a React app on your local system. Make sure you have Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager) installed before proceeding.


## Prerequisites


- **Node.js:** Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/).

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/AkshitDh/basic_recruiter_tool_frontend.git


Navigate to the Project Directory:

cd basic_recruiter_tool_frontend


2. **Install Dependencies:**

npm install

3. **Setup the environment variables**
